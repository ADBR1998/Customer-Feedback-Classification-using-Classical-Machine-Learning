# Customer-Feedback-Classification-using-Classical-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on classifying customer feedback into two categories — complaints and suggestions — using classical machine learning algorithms and TF-IDF feature extraction. It demonstrates practical text classification using interpretable models for real-world business data.

**Objectives**
Clean and preprocess customer feedback text data
Extract meaningful features using TF-IDF vectorization
Train and evaluate classical ML models for binary classification

**Dataset**
The dataset consists of real or simulated customer feedback entries.
Each entry is labeled as either:
Complaint
Suggestion

****Techniques Used:****
**Text Preprocessing**
Lowercasing, punctuation removal
Stop word removal
Tokenization
**Feature Engineering**
TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization

**Classification Algorithms**
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Evaluation Metrics**
Accuracy
Precision / Recall / F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
